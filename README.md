# Point-Shoot

Point-Shoot!, also simply called Space Shooter, was the first real Unity game that I made as my first One Game A Month game. It was a simple gauntlet shooter that I never finished due to constraints of time and the limited options. It was also the first game of mine to use procedural generation, where each enemy is randomly spawned and each type of enemy is spawned differently. This game was made back when Templarius Studios was originally named Ragnarok Games. Abilities and more features were to be made at a later date, however since the game was never finished nor pogressed, this was never added.

The build is available in the "build" folder. The source is available in the "source" folder.

This project uses Unity 5.4.0f3. Due to the age of the engine, it is possible that updating to the most recent engine version may cause issues.
