Game Rules:

1. Player is in the middle, unable to move and can only rotate. Aim and fire to destroy as many enemies as you can
and try to survive for as many waves as possible.

2. Player has infinite ammunition and a 0.3 second delay between each fire. 

3. Enemies will damage the player when in contact with the player. To prevent enemies from stacking on the player, the player
also deals the same type of damage. (Beware of the Titan; it will kill you faster than you can kill it!)

4. Enemies will continue to come for the player until the player is dead.

5. Player's maximum health is 150 and at the end of a wave (1 minute), if the player's health is below 50, they will be restored to 100.
